# SubSpace Blog

This is a Flutter app that showcases a list of blogs and articles.



 **Prerequisites**
  Before you can build and run the Flutter app, make sure you have the following installed on your system:
 - Flutter SDK (version 2.0.0 or higher)
 - Android Studio (for Android development)
 - Xcode (for iOS development)
 - Git

 **Getting Started**

 1. **Clone the Repository**
     - Open a terminal or command prompt.
     - Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.
     - Run the following command to clone the repository:
       ```bash
       git clone https://github.com/SamarS1ngh/subspace.git
       ```

       This will create a new project directory with the basic Flutter structure.

 2. **Install Dependencies**
     - Navigate to the project directory:
       ```bash
       cd subspace
       ```
     - Install the required dependencies:
       ```bash
       flutter pub get
       ```
  3. **Run the App (Android)**
      - Open the project in Android Studio or your preferred IDE.
      - Connect an Android device or start an Android emulator.
      - In the terminal, run the following command to install the app on the device/emulator:
        ```bash
        flutter run
        ```
      - Alternatively, you can run the app directly from Android Studio.
